I do not own the GCPhone and do not take credit for the work.

Install

Download and put in you resource folder.

add      start gcphone     in your server.cfg and enjoy


If you are alredy using gcphone just rename your old one and replace it with this one.



Since the creator of GCPhone dropped his work i do not know who to contact. So if some one 
want me to del it just tell me.




Hope you enjoy it!!!
